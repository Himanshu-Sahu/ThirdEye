# ThirdEye - Your Desktop Guard
It was our project in OOAD. Me and Mehul Jain work in a team of two to create a security application for Windows platform. 

The most challenging job which we face in starting of this projest was how to built it.
I only had a idea about batch programming language which I came across in Ethical Hacking Workshop at IIT-Indore in Feb'17.
We decided to made a application which can take screenshot after regular interval and register the USB entry whenever a new is connected or removed.
It took lot of time to collect proper resources for building error free application.

We enjoy and learn hell lot of things during development of our project.
